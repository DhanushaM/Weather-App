Project Overview

The Weather App is a high-performance, real-time weather forecasting application designed using Vite and built with modern web technologies including HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript.
This project delivers accurate and up-to-date weather information powered by the OpenWeatherMap API, allowing users to effortlessly search for any global location and view detailed meteorological data including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and weather conditions.

Built with a focus on scalability, responsiveness, and user experience, the app leverages modular code architecture, API key protection through environment variables, and the lightning-fast build system of Vite. 
The UI is clean and responsive, adapting seamlessly across devices, and the development workflow is optimized for maintainability and future enhancements.

This project demonstrates:
- Real-world API integration and secure credential handling
- Clean code structure with separation of concerns
- Environment-based configuration using `.env` and Vite's `import.meta.env`
- Hands-on implementation of asynchronous JavaScript for data fetching
- Practical deployment readiness with `npm run build` for static hosting

The Weather App not only serves as a useful utility but also showcases the application of professional frontend development standards, making it a strong addition to any developer's portfolio.
